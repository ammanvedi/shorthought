***

Shorthought was built in about 5 hours. the site uses **Azure**, **PHP**, **MYSQL**, **HTML** and **CSS**. Users post a thought that is stored in a database with all of the users thoughts, random thoughts are grabbed from the MYSQL Server and shown to the user.

The SQL server that the site used to fucntion is no longer live, so any attempts to run the code will need to swap out the sql server connection strings first .
